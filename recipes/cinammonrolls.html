    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Making homemade cinnamon rolls is a time-consuming process. 
        Between making the dough, letting the dough rise (twice, for that matter),
        assembling them, and baking, there's just no way to feasibly make them for
        breakfast without waking up at the crack of dawn. But overnight cinnamon
        rolls are a different story: By doing the bulk of the work the night before
        you can wake up, immediately pop them in the oven, and enjoy warm,
        ooey-gooey cinnamon rolls in no time.

Luckily, any cinnamon roll recipe can be turned into an overnight version and without much effort—you just need to know how. Here’s everything you need to know about turning any cinnamon roll recipe into overnight cinnamon rolls.
